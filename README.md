## fastai-dl2-2019-resources-notes
This repository contains my notes and resources from the 2019 version of the fastai dl2 course. They sort of follow the notebooks at https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/tree/master/dev_course/dl2 but I added a few extra bits so I can understand/remember what was in the lectures. It's very much a work in progress. 

### Topics 
1. understanding the pytorch nn Module system [md](https://github.com/wwymak/fastai-dl2-2019-resources-notes/blob/master/1-pytorch%20nn%20Module.md), [notebook](https://github.com/wwymak/fastai-dl2-2019-resources-notes/blob/master/1-pytorch%20nn%20Module.ipynb)
2. neural net training [md](), [notebook](https://github.com/wwymak/fastai-dl2-2019-resources-notes/blob/master/2_Training.ipynb)
